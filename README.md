## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

# Quiz: four types of programmers

## Problem Solver
Programmers tend to be all analytical right? True, but hardly everyone is analytical, methodical and interested in processes.

Analytical programmers tend to really enjoy solving challenging problems using algorithms that may be more complex than usual; they are serious about code organization best practices, so they know the books by Martin Fowler and Robert C Martin; have fun refactoring and solving difficult bugs; and finally, they tend to have a good mathematical background.

## Hands On

This is the guy who is basically concerned with solving the company's problem, with delivering, he doesn't care much about best practices, so you will rarely see this type in companies like Google, Facebook or others whose heart is 100% technological .

The Practical tends to complement the Analytical well, as it tends to take a more short-term view, avoiding unnecessary complexities. Also, you tend to enjoy activities that would be menial for an analytic type, like server configurations and using tools.

## Tecnician

This guy is what I call a technical programmer, he loves technology and gets bored with business discussions and time estimates. When the subject is technical, however, he raises his antennae and has strong opinions on the subject.

Tecnician always likes to stay on top of the latest technologies and is a fan of technology in general, not just programming. They also enjoy well-executed code execution, like analytics, but more focused on the micro rather than the macro.

The executor enjoys programming so much that he sees no problem pursuing a career as a developer and often doesn't have much leadership pretensions.

## The Designer

The designer is the programmer whose perfectionism is channeled into the user experience, therefore he is a programmer made for the Front-End. This guy enjoys everything related to this area and will take pride in doing responsive screens, effects and other tasks that other programmers reportedly don't like to do.
